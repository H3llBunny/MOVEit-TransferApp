<h1 align="center">A quick guide:</h1>

1. <span>Download the latest release:</span>  
   <a href="https://github.com/H3llBunny/MOVEit-TransferApp/releases/latest">
     <img src="https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/H3llBunny/MOVEit-TransferApp"/>
   </a>

2. <span>Unzip the file and search for:</span>  
   <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34f927be-a0c2-472f-b36d-6907d0350ea8"/>

3. Execute it and wait for the cmd to show you the following:

4. You can minimize the CMD and access the web interface of the app on <a href="https://localhost:7191">https://localhost:7191</a> or <a href="http://localhost:5176">http://localhost:5176</a>
5. Provide your MOVEit Transfer credentials.
6. Select path to any local folder:

7. Once a path is selected you should see something like this:

   <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95eefd71-39de-46d9-98dd-42312f7c3b72" />
8. The program is now monitoring the selected folder and files will be uploaded to your MOVEit Transfer home folder. The notifications in red mean that the file is a duplicate (already uploaded on the server).

The program is still in early stages and has some bugs to be fixed. I managed to upload 400 MB single file, however when I tested with 2.3 GB I get an error: "Hash of file did not match correct value", so I need more playtime with it.
